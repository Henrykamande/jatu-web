            <b>JUBILANT AFRO FARMS</b> is a global platform designed to unlock and provide access to the hidden potential of
            agricultural opportunities in African countries. Africa is facing a major food crisis and has the highest
            rate of hunger and food insecurity in the world. It’s estimated that by 2030 African population will reach
            1.7 billion people, and food will be a serious major problem for many families on the continent.
          </p>
          <br />

          <p>
            We believe Africa can feed itself and we dare to make this dream a reality. But still, there is stive challenge
            for many people in acquiring land in different countries across Africa, we have selected the best countries
            with enough land and we are championing food production through partnership programs.
          </p>
          <br />

          <p>
            Take for example Tanzania, beside of being huge and with extensive arable land, this country can feed Africa
            as it is bordering over eight countries such as Kenya, Uganda, Burundi, Congo DR, Zambia, Malawi, Mozambique,
            and Rwanda, and it has the Indian Ocean on the east coast that connects Africa to the world, particularly
            China and India where food market is huge.

          Tanzania is one of the most peaceful countries in Africa, with a clear and supportive government policy,
          particularly in agriculture and international trade. Having good climatic conditions, a lot of rivers,
          lakes, and underground waters; the installation of modern irrigation farming projects, are cheap and possible.
          Nevertheless, this beautiful country is not well-developed in agriculture.
        </p>
        <br />

        <p>
          However, Africa in general has a huge potential land for agriculture, most land being a virgin, untapped and
          underutilized, through the partnership program, we do research, project analysis, and give insights on
          high-return investment opportunities available in the agriculture industry as well as provide smooth
          mechanisms and procedures to partner with local farmers to implement the selected projects in different countries.
        </p>
        <br />

        <p>
          <b>JUBILANT AFRO FARMS</b> is coordinating the farm owners, agricultural experts, and agri-investors by allowing the farm
          owners to register their farms on the site for leasing and partnership, and the investor gets a chance to lease
          the registered farms and engage the agricultural expert through the system. The platform is also selling
          different agricultural products direct from the farms, and agricultural equipment, machinery, inputs,
          and tools direct from the manufacturers to the farmers to make modern agriculture possible.

            GASAYA THE FARMER is a determined entrepreneur who was born and raised in a farmer’s family along the lake Victoria basin in Tanzania.
            He is a Law graduate from the University of Dar es salaam. He has used his good knowledge of Law to establish and run a number
            of extensive agricultural projects in the region.
          </p>
          <br />

          <p>
            Traveling in different African countries and looking around his local communities, he has seen the suffering of a lot
            of families and communities due to poverty and food insecurity despite the huge potential of land existing in Africa.
            He realized that many people are suffering because they lack proper information, guidance, and business connections.
          </p>
          <br />

          <p>
            With his remarkable experience in Agriculture and Law, he partnered with his friend in Kenya to create a global platform to link partnerships and coordinate local opportunities to global forums. He believes, once the hidden potential of African farmlands is unlocked, Africa will become a food self-sufficient basket and create a lot of employment and businesses in the agriculture value
            chain to fight against poverty.
